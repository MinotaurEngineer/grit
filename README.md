# Fitness Testing Portal (Grit)

A web app to explore entry requirements and fitness tests for military and civil services worldwide.

## Overview

This site lets users browse physical fitness standards for roles in military branches (Army, Navy, Special Forces) and civil services (Police, Fire Service, Medical Service). Filter by country, service, branch, and difficulty, with detailed test breakdowns and scoring.

## Features

- Filterable test database by Country, Service, Branch, and Difficulty
- Detailed test views (e.g., German Navy’s Basis-Fitness-Test with components like shuttle runs)
- Responsive, lightweight UI for quick browsing

## Purpose

Built to help users prepare for the physical demands of military and civil service roles. As a portfolio piece, it showcases my ability to craft fast, functional web apps with modern tools.

## Tech Stack & Skills

- **Preact**: Leveraged its lightweight nature for a snappy UI (3kB vs React’s heftier footprint)
- **Vite**: Used for rapid dev cycles and optimized production builds
- **Wouter**: Implemented clean, minimal routing for seamless navigation
- **Signals**: Managed reactive state for dynamic filtering without bloat
- **GitHub Pages**: Automated deployment via `gh-pages` for a live, accessible app
- **Data Handling**: Designed a structured dataset of 30+ fitness tests, parsed efficiently in the frontend

Highlights: Optimized for performance (e.g., lazy-loaded components), crafted a custom filtering system, and ensured mobile-friendly design.
